## Senior Year and the World Beyond

Senior year, for any student, is a scary time. The anxiety looms as I begin to apply for jobs
and or consider continuing my schooling. Additionally, the comfort that
being a student provided, and the cushion of being on the edge of adulthood will be gone. <br/><br/>

It is a privilege to be in the position I am in now. After all, I'm a student attending a top-10 university. However, sometimes I fear I didn't do enough with my time. <br/><br/>

So, as the future looms near I hope I can make the most of it.
